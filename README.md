# IDEA Web Ring & Coding Club

A student-led web ring connecting personal portfolio sites across IDEA School of Design. This project fosters coding culture, collaboration, and creative expression through hands-on web development.

**Live Site:** https://jamesdneufeld.github.io/ideawebring/

## 🚀 Quick Start for Students

### 1. Build Your Page

Create your personal site in your assigned folder. Keep it simple to start—customize fonts, colors, and layouts as you learn.

### 2. Add the Web Ring Navigation

Copy the web ring navigation HTML into your page to connect to the IDEA Web Ring. Ask James for the navigation snippet.

### 3. Add a Page View Counter (Optional)

Add the page view counter HTML to track views for your page. The counter script is available in the shared toolkit.

### 4. Publish Your Page

- Open your folder in VS Code
- Make your edits (HTML, CSS, JS snippets)
- Commit your changes with descriptive messages
- Push to GitHub
- View your live page at: https://jamesdneufeld.github.io/ideawebring/your-folder/

## 🛠️ Toolkit & Resources

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By participating in the web ring, students gain:

- Real developer workflows: VS Code, GitHub Desktop, GitHub Pages
- Collaborative coding experience in shared repositories
- Hands-on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills
- Understanding of how individual work contributes to a larger creative ecosystem
- Professional practices like writing clear commit messages and managing version control

## 🔁 How Web Rings Work

Every site in the web ring includes navigation links:

- **Previous site** – goes to the previous student's page
- **Next site** – goes to the next student's page
- **Central hub** – the main IDEA Web Ring page

This creates an endless loop of connected, handcrafted sites—classic internet style, no feeds, no algorithms, just creativity and community.

## 💫 The Vision

The IDEA Web Ring started as a passion project and has grown into a school-wide initiative to build coding culture. It's a classic web aesthetic with a modern, community-driven twist: intentional, curious, and collaborative.
