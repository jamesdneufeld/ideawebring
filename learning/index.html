        <h2>Teaching Methods & Learning Approach</h2>
        <p>This learning resource explores how the <strong>IDEA Web Ring</strong> serves as both a technical project and educational framework. We blend nostalgic web concepts with modern development practices to create meaningful learning experiences.</p>
        <p>It's <em>constructivist learning in action</em>—where students build knowledge by creating real things and connecting with peers.</p>
        <p><em>Discover the teaching philosophy behind my coding curriculum and how I make web development accessible to design students.</em></p>

         WHY WEB RINGS?
    ================================= -->
    <section class="concept-section">
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>Why Web Rings?</h2>
        <p>The IDEA Web Ring revives a classic form of online connection — the <strong>web ring</strong> — as both a design experiment and a pedagogical tool. It invites students to experience how digital communities were once formed: by hand, with intent, and through shared curiosity rather than algorithms.</p>
        <div class="course-context">
          <p>By recreating this early-internet tradition, students gain insight into the <strong>social history</strong> of the web while learning <strong>modern front-end development practices</strong>. This blend of old and new creates a space for exploration, reflection, and technical growth.</p>

     TEACHING PHILOSOPHY
================================= -->
    <section class="methodology-section">
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>Our Learning Environment</h2>
        <p>This course embraces a <strong>"teaching as code"</strong> approach—where lessons evolve in real-time based on class discussions, questions, and collective progress.</p>

        <div class="course-context">
          <p>💡 <strong>Why this matters:</strong> Just as the web itself adapts to user needs, our course content adapts to your learning journey.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <ul class="course-outcomes">
          <li>📁 <strong>Structured Foundations</strong> – You start with organized files (HTML, CSS, GitHub) to eliminate setup frustrations</li>
          <li>🔄 <strong>Fluid Demos</strong> – New examples and exercises appear in your folder as we explore topics together</li>
          <li>🎯 <strong>Responsive Teaching</strong> – Content evolves based on your questions and the class's unique rhythm</li>
          <li>💾 <strong>Version Control</strong> – GitHub becomes our shared learning space, replacing scattered files and confusing zips</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This approach has evolved through 30 years of teaching web development—from chalkboards to overhead projectors to Dropbox—and represents the most effective way I've found to balance structure with flexibility.</p>

        <div class="course-context">
          <p>✨ <em>You focus on learning to code while I handle the infrastructure pain points that often derail beginners.</em></p>

         PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH
    ================================= -->
    <section class="concept-section">
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>The Pedagogical Approach</h2>
        <p>The web ring project is rooted in <strong>constructivist learning</strong> — students build knowledge by creating real things and connecting with peers. Rather than following abstract tutorials, every student’s site becomes a living example of experimentation, iteration, and visual storytelling.</p>
        <div class="course-context">
          <p>💡 The goal isn’t just to make a website — it’s to <em>understand how the web itself works</em>, from HTML structure to hosting, linking, and version control.</p>
        </div>
        <p>This mirrors professional workflows, where design and development intersect. Students learn to work within a shared repository, make commits, and see how individual creative voices contribute to a collective online presence.</p>

        <h2>How It Fits Into IXD 108</h2>
        <div class="course-context">
          <p>In <strong>IXD 108 – Coding for Designers</strong>, students explore the fundamentals of web structure and layout using HTML, CSS, and GitHub. The web ring integrates seamlessly into the course by giving these lessons a tangible, collaborative outcome.</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="course-outcomes">
          <li>🕸️ Understand the architecture of the early web</li>
          <li>💻 Practice HTML & CSS for real-world publishing</li>
          <li>🔗 Use GitHub for version control and collaboration</li>
          <li>🌐 Host and link personal sites through GitHub Pages</li>
          <li>🤝 Strengthen peer-to-peer creative connections</li>

         LEARNING JOURNEY
    ================================= -->
    <section class="process-section">
      <div class="text-section">
        <h2>The Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>Each student’s participation follows a simple but creative progression — from setup to reflection. It’s designed to build confidence in the core languages of the web before moving into complex tools and interactivity.</p>
        <ol class="course-outcomes">
          <li>1️⃣ <strong>Set up your space</strong> – Create your first HTML page and connect CSS.</li>
          <li>2️⃣ <strong>Join the ring</strong> – Add your site to the shared GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>3️⃣ <strong>Publish live</strong> – Deploy your page with GitHub Pages so it’s visible online.</li>
          <li>4️⃣ <strong>Iterate</strong> – Experiment with layout, color, and typography to express your style.</li>
          <li>5️⃣ <strong>Reflect</strong> – See your page as part of a growing creative network.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="course-context">
          <p>💡 <em>This introductory course focuses on the fundamentals of structure, style, hierarchy, and responsive design using basic HTML & CSS. Advanced interactive components — like tabs, accordions, toggles, forms, or JavaScript features — are not recommended for beginners.</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>Understanding these fundamentals allows designers to make informed, intentional decisions — and to collaborate more effectively in future courses or projects.</p>
        <p>The process builds both technical literacy and design sensitivity — skills essential to interaction design in the 21st century.</p>

        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>This initiative reflects the values of the <strong>Indie Web</strong>: creativity, autonomy, and connection. In an era of closed platforms and automated feeds, the IDEA Web Ring celebrates the slow, intentional web — one where designers shape their digital identities with purpose.</p>
        <p>By participating, students don’t just learn web design; they contribute to a living archive of student creativity and community.</p>
